# Sustainability

Blockchains have a reputation for being resource-intensive and having a negative impact on the environment, contributing to climate change.

However, Juno and its underlying blockchain network, the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/), do **not** share these issues.

Thanks to its innovative architecture and cryptography, the Internet Computer offers efficiency comparable to traditional software run on big tech cloud services.

Nevertheless, it still has a significant emissions footprint that will increase with adoption.

To address this, various initiatives of different sizes and complexities are being considered to reduce the carbon intensity of the network in the future.

Despite this, Juno provides already developers with an energy-efficient platform to build and launch on blockchain with minimal carbon impact.
