# Roadmap

Juno is currently in closed beta but has big plans for the near and distant future.

## Features

Our goal is to continue delivering features that seamlessly integrate both web3 and web2 worlds, while ensuring ease of development. This includes:

- Analytics
- Plug-and-play recurring payment and paywall solutions
- Handing over [mission control] or [satellite] to DAO SNS (Service Nervous Systems)

## Templates store

We aim to launch new features and more advanced templates in our [satellites], such as "rockets" or "space stations.".

With unified interfaces, we envision a future where developers can sell their own smart contract templates.

## Infrastructure

To support growth and foster new ideas, we aim to make various infrastructure improvements, including:

- Adding additional [authentication](build/authentication.md) providers
- Upgrading [satellites] overall available memory, starting with 64 GB
- Enabling the implementation of backend functions in response to events triggered in [satellites]
- Replacing quick queries with certified calls by default
- Automatically topping up [mission control] and [satellites]
- Providing real-time data updates
- Server-side rendering

## Developer tooling

Easing the development process will always be a priority. To that end, we plan to provide:

- A local emulator suite for developers to build and test their apps
- Integration with GitHub actions and other CI tools
- Continuously updated documentation, along with sample repos and tutorials.
